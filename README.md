# ITIS-6177 - System Integration (MS) at UNC Charlotte with Prof. Fabio Nolasco

This Master's level course commits to teaching students the variety of methods that systems communicate with each other. 

The final project (FACE-API) of the course was to develop an API that leverages Microsoft's Facial Recognition tools with proper documentation and a great user (developer) experience.

This was my first experience developing a GraphQL and absolutely loved the process and results. 

**Prof. Nolasco graded the project as "the best final project he has ever seen for this course"**
